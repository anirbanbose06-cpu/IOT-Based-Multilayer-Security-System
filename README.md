## Overview

The **IoT-Based Multilayer Security System** is designed to combine multiple security layers — such as motion detection, laser barrier, alarms, etc. — under an IoT framework. This allows remote monitoring, alerting, and active response in case of security breaches.

This project is suited for home security, small establishments, or IoT learning projects.

## Features

- Multi-layer sensing (e.g. laser beam interruption, motion detection)  
- Local alarm (buzzer, LED, etc.)  
- Remote alerting (via IoT / network)  
- Real-time monitoring of sensor states  
- Configurable threshold or sensitivity  
- Expandable architecture for additional sensors or actuators

Each layer monitors or reacts to breaches. The microcontroller is central, interacting with sensors, actuators (alarms), and network to send/receive data.

## Hardware Components

Here’s a list of typical components used in this project (modify as per your build):

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Microcontroller / Board (e.g. Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32) | Core unit to process sensor input, control actuators, and handle communications |
| Laser module + photodiode / LDR / IR sensor | For beam break detection |
| PIR motion sensor | To detect movement in area |
| Buzzer / Alarm | To produce audible alarm on trigger |
| LEDs | Visual status indicators |
| Resistors, wires, breadboard / PCB | For connecting circuits |
| Power supply / battery | To power the setup |
| Optional: WiFi module (if microcontroller doesn’t have built-in network) |

Also in the repository you have a sketch file: `laser_dectector_alarm_final.ino` — that likely contains the Arduino code handling the laser detection and alarm logic.

## Software & Libraries

You’ll need the following software / libraries:

- Arduino IDE (or compatible environment)  
- Board package (e.g. for ESP8266, ESP32)  
- Supporting libraries (depending on your sensors / modules), e.g.:
  - `ESP8266WiFi.h` or `WiFi.h`
  - MQTT / HTTP client library (if using IoT communication)
  - Sensor libraries (e.g. for PIR, LDR, etc.)  
- (Optional) Backend / server: MQTT broker / web server / dashboard (e.g. Node-RED, Adafruit IO, or custom)

Make sure your code includes the correct pin definitions and initialization for each sensor and module.

## Circuit & Wiring

Here’s a high-level wiring summary (you may include or sketch a full circuit schematic in your repository):

1. Connect laser emitter to Vcc and GND.
2. The photodiode / sensor connected to an analog (or digital) input on the microcontroller.
3. PIR motion sensor: Vcc, GND, and output to a digital input pin.
4. Buzzer / alarm: controlled via a digital pin (possibly through a transistor or driver, if current > microcontroller pin limit).
5. LEDs: with appropriate series resistors to indicate status (armed, triggered, etc.).
6. (If used) WiFi / communication module: TX / RX or SPI or appropriate interface to microcontroller.
7. Power: ensure common ground across all modules.

Include pull-up or pull-down resistors as needed depending on sensor modules.

If possible, generate a circuit diagram (e.g. via Fritzing) and include it in your repo (e.g. `hardware/diagram.png`).
